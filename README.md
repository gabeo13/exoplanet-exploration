## Background & Challenge

Over a period of nine years in deep space, the NASA Kepler space telescope has been out on a planet-hunting mission to discover hidden planets outside of our solar system.

To help process this data, create machine learning models capable of classifying candidate exoplanets from the [raw dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/nasa/kepler-exoplanet-search-results).
